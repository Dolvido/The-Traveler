# The Traveler

The Traveler is a Python-based framework designed to simulate interdimensional travel. It provides a structured approach for managing dimensions, locations within those dimensions, and travelers capable of navigating between them.

## Features

- **Dimension Management**: Define and manage multiple dimensions with distinct characteristics.
- **Location Tracking**: Keep track of various locations within each dimension.
- **Traveler Control**: Control the movement of travelers between dimensions and locations.
- **Permission Handling**: Define rules for access between dimensions and enforce entry permissions for travelers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/The-Traveler.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd The-Traveler
    ```

3. Run the sample code or integrate the framework into your project.

### Usage

```python
from interdimensional_travel import InterdimensionalTravelFramework, Dimension, Traveler

# Create an instance of the travel framework
travel_framework = InterdimensionalTravelFramework()

# Define dimensions
dimension_1 = Dimension("Dimension 1")
dimension_2 = Dimension("Dimension 2")

# Add dimensions to the framework
travel_framework.add_dimension("Dimension 1", dimension_1)
travel_framework.add_dimension("Dimension 2", dimension_2)

# Define locations within dimensions
dimension_1.add_location("Location A")
dimension_1.add_location("Location B")
dimension_2.add_location("Location X")
dimension_2.add_location("Location Y")

# Create a traveler
alice = Traveler("Alice")

# Initiate travel
travel_framework.travel("Dimension 1", "Dimension 2", alice)
```
